# Laptop // Tobisha

I found this laying around in my basement and decided to find a purpose for my server. The screen on the laptop 
is broken, but it functions well enough. It could not connect via to my TV via an HDMI cable at first; after 
fiddling with it, I realized that the screen needed to be lifted up and closed imediatley after powering the system on.
