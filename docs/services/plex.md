# Plex

Plex is the app that allows me to view my media. It is an extremely powerful media center with auto searching of
folders, auto grabbing of posters, transcoding built in, ability to sign in with a Google account and so much more.
Plex is available to me anywhere in the world on both the web and the mobile app.
